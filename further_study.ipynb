    "- [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/)  \n",
    "This is a free class for people with a little bit of programming experience who want to learn Python. It is created for Python version 2, but most of it is relevant for version 3 as well. Has video lectures, exercises, and summary of most important concepts. Experience sitting in Google classroom!  \n",
    "- [CS50](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science)  \n",
    "Harvard's Computer Science 50 has been the single most popular course taken at Harvard in recent years. People who aren't even CS majors sign up to take the course. It is offered not only to enrolled students on campus, but also adapted for following online, for free. This is not an easy course, but if you are serious about getting into programming or computer science in general, consider taking this course. You will find it challenging yet rewarding, you will need to be persistent to progress. This is a time investment that is sure to pay off.  \n",

    "### Books\n",
    "These books came up repeatedly when searching internet for best introductory books on Python.\n",
    "- [Automate the Boring Stuff With Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)  \n",
    "If you've ever spent hours renaming files or updating hundreds of spreadsheet cells, you know how tedious tasks like these can be. But what if you could have your computer do them for you?\n",
    "In Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, you'll learn how to use Python to write programs that do in minutes what would take you hours to do by hand-no prior programming experience required.  \n",
    "Short [video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0-84-yl1fUnRuXGFe_F7qSH1LEnn9LkW) also available on youtube. \n",
    "- [Learn Python the Hardway](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/)  \n",
    "This is a collection of 52 perfectly collated exercises. The great thing about this book is how well the content is presented. Each chapter is clearly presented. The code examples are all concise, well constructed, and to the point. The exercises are instructive, and any problems you run into will not be at all insurmountable. Your biggest risk is typographical errors. Make it through this book, and you'll definitely no longer be a beginner at Python.\n",
    "- [Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-Hands-Project-Based/dp/1593276036/ref=sr_1_9)  \n",

    "This will help you understand how Python code gets executed (interpreted) line by line, i.e. this reveals step by step what happens after you run the code. These exercises will help you understand the working of software, structure of a well-written program and how to avoid and find common mistakes in code using some tricks that professional programmers have up their sleeves.\n",

    "### Coding style\n",
    "- [Why code style is so important in Python?](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/style/)  \n",
    "If you ask Python programmers what they like most about Python, they will often cite its high readability. Indeed, a high level of readability is at the heart of the design of the Python language, following the recognized fact that code is read much more often than it is written.  \n",
    "One reason for the high readability of Python code is its relatively complete set of Code Style guidelines and “Pythonic” idioms.  \n",
    "When a veteran Python developer (a Pythonista) calls portions of code not “Pythonic”, they usually mean that these lines of code do not follow the common guidelines and fail to express its intent in what is considered the best (hear: most readable) way.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Tests  \n",
    "A unit test is a scripted code-level test, written in Python to verify a small \"unit\" of functionality. Unit tests, in general, are often designed to provide a broad testing coverage of the web application, including any weird corner cases and some tests that should not work.  \n",
