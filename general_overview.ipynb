    "## What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an **open-source**, **high-level**, **interpreted** scripting language developed in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands. The initial version was published in 1991, and version 1.0 released in 1994. Python was designed to be **easy-to-read** but also powerful. Guido van Rossum named it after the television show [Monty Python's Flying Circus](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python%27s_Flying_Circus). \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Open-source**. Python is freely usable and distributable, even for commercial use.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- **High-level**. Python is a high-level language, which means it is _far removed_ from computer's hardware. _Assembler_ is an example of _low level_ programming language, it directly deals with computer's hardware and architecture. Using a high-level language a programmer can focus on what to do instead of how to do it. C++, Java, Visual Basic are some of the other high-level languages besides Python. The trade-off is that a high-level language tends to be slower than low-level language. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- **Interpreted**. Python is an interpreted language. Interpreted languages do not need to be compiled to run. A program called an [interpreter](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)) runs Python code on almost any kind of computer. This means that a programmer can change the code and quickly see the results. This also means Python is slower than a compiled language like [C](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), because it is not running [machine code](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code) directly.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- **Easy to read**. Python has a very easy-to-read syntax. It is clean, uncluttered, requires fewer lines of code compared to some other languages.  Whereas other languages require learning a lot of complex commands, Python follows a more natural, intuitive syntax which is more like an ordinary human language. Some of Python's syntax comes from C, because that is the language that Python was written in. But Python uses whitespace to delimit code: spaces or tabs are used to organize code into groups. This is different from C. In C, there is a semicolon at the end of each line and curly braces {} used to group code. Using whitespace to delimit code makes Python a very easy-to-read language.  \n",

    "## Why choose Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "The appeal of Python is in its combination of **simplicity** and **power**.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Thanks to it's easy syntax and flow which is more akin to a natural human language than complex commands, it is easy to learn. Python requires fewer lines compared to some other programming languages and is easier to read. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Despite being relatively simple to learn, Python is powerful and versatile. It's power comes from a large number of available packages (170k+ as of Mar2019) and it is used in areas as diverse as:\n",

    "For all its syntactical simplicity, Python supports most constructs that would be expected in a very high-level language, including complex dynamic [data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type), [structured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming) and [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) programming, and [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) programming.\n",

The rise of data science also help Python popularity grow: according to another *Stack Overflow* [report](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/14/python-growing-quickly/) among the fastest-growing uses of Python is for data science and machine learning. As more and more companies turn to BigData, Python becomes a common choice to deal with it.\n",

    "<br><br>\n",
    "If you do need to install python, you can download the latest python3 version from www.python.org. This is a bare-bones, official version of python only including the essential packages. Python also comes in various distributions, whereby the standard python interpreter is packaged together with some of the more often used libraries. One such example is [Anaconda python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) which includes commonly used data science libraries: numpy, scipy, pandas, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Packages\n",
    "Packages can be managed via **pip** which usually comes pre-installed together with Python. **Pip** is a [package management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager) used to install and manage software [packages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_(package_management_system)) written in Python. Many packages can be found in the default source for packages and their dependencies — [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/).\n",

    "You can upgrade to latest pip version by typing into Command Prompt (win) / Terminal (mac):  \n",

    "## Code editing environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you successfully verified you have python installed, you will need an environment to write the actual code in. You can choose between simple code editors, highly advanced IDEs (integrated development environments) or Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code editors\n",
    "Code editors are small, quick and simple to use. Some of the more popular ones include *Sublime Text, Notepad++, Text Wrangler(mac)*. They usually provide code highlighting among other features and are sufficient for small programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### IDEs\n",
    "IDEs on the other hand, are rich with tools to make development easier (syntax highlighting, auto-completion, debugging, source control, etc.). They usually support many programming languages beyond python. They may be offered free or as paid versions. Some of the more popular ones include *PyCharm, Eclipse.*\n",

    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook (formerly known as IPython) is another coding environment to consider. It is nor traditional code editor, nor an IDE. It is a web-application that allows editing and running code via web browser. It shares some features of a code editor, but also has features that makes it unique. Jupyter notebook integrates code and its output into a single document that combines visualisations, narrative text, mathematical equations, other rich media and also supports markdown. The intuitive workflow promotes iterative and rapid development. It is an incredibly powerful tool for interactively developing and presenting data science projects, hence it's recent rise in popularity. Best of all, as part of the open source Project Jupyter, it is are completely free.  \n",

    "Codewars is a community of developers, who are called Code Warriors (or just warriors), that train on improving their development skills. Think of it like a coding dojo - where developers train with each other and help each other get better through practice.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Every time you complete a challenge (which we call \"kata\") you will be shown the solutions that others came up with. Until you try it yourself, you really won't know how great of a feeling it is to complete a kata thinking you nailed it and then see how others did it, or how many different types of approaches are possible. It is an amazing way to learn and adapt new techniques.  \n",

    "- **Kata**. \n",
    "In our dojo, kata are real code challenges focused on improving skill and technique. Some train programming fundamentals, while others focus on complex problem solving. Each kata is crafted for and by the community.\n",
    "- **Kyu/Dan Ranks**. \n",
    "Each kata on the site is set to a Kyu/Dan rank, based on its subject area and difficulty. The community collectively determines rank in the Beta Process. Every new Codewarrior (user) on Codewars starts being ranked as 8 Kyu.\n",
    "What are Kyu and Dan? The terms are borrowed from a system in Japanese martial arts, which is in turn borrowed from the game of Go. Kyu indicates the number of degrees away from master level (Dan). This is why they count downward. Once you reach master level, we count upward.\n",
    "Currently Dan level content is reserved for later. You will only find Kyu level content to train on for now.\n",
    "![ranks](images/codewars_ranks.png)\n",
    "- **Earning Ranks**. \n",
    "You can advance through the ranks by completing kata at or above your rank - the harder the kata the faster you advance.\n",
    "- **Honor**. \n",
    "Honor represents the level of respect a user has earned from the community, based on their skill and contributions. Honor is earned fastest through creating kata, crafting great solutions, and constructive comments."
